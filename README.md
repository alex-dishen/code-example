Hi Swivl Developers ðŸ‘‹,

This repository was created to showcase some of the business logic I worked on. I had to remove a significant amount of code from this repository due to confidentiality, so there may be some imports I missed that do not reference anything. Apologies in advance if you encounter any of these.

Additionally, the routing included here was not written by me, but the rest of the code is a small piece of what I did.

Feel free to reach out if you need any additional information, or we can discuss it further during the interview. :)
